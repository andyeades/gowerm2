                <p>We all know how frustrating it is when your lovely bed is delivered to your home yet it can&rsquo;t fit through your front door. It would be even worse if, once the bed is forced through multiple doors and been assembled, you realise that it doesn&rsquo;t fit in your bedroom.</p>
                <p>To make sure that this doesn&rsquo;t happen to you, we have created this handy measuring guide.</p>

                <h2><strong>How to Find the Right Size Bed</strong></h2>
                <p>This guide will help you fully measure your bedroom in order to buy the correct size furniture. However, you should take note of the new furniture&rsquo;s complete measurements, so that you&rsquo;ll be able to determine if it also fits through all doors, stairways and hallways in your home.</p>
                <p>You need to ask yourself these important questions before ordering:</p>
                <ul classs="mb-3">
                        <li>&bull; Will there be a problem with low ceilings, narrow hallways, and stair banisters?</li>
                        <li>&bull; Will there be any tight corners?</li>
                        <li>&bull; In your room, will there be enough space for the door to open?</li>
                        <li>&bull; Do you want the furniture delivered flat packed or fully assembled?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&bull; Once assembled, will there be enough room to access all drawers and wardrobes?</p>
                <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Tight corners won&rsquo;t be a problem for mattresses because these are quite flexible. However, bigger mattresses may be harder to squeeze in and you may need assistance.</p>
                <p>Our team can&rsquo;t remove windows and doors in order for our furniture to get into your home. If this is the case, you will be responsible for taking it inside.</p>

                    <p>Take note that for hallways where there&rsquo;s no room for turning, the door should be 100 mm wider than A or B as indicated.</p>
                    <p>For some furniture, there needs to be additional space to this: there should be an allowance on top of the specified dimensions.</p>
                    <p>For example, the divan beds with drawers will require 31 cm from either side of the bed if you&rsquo;re going to place it in a room where there isn&rsquo;t enough space to turn.</p>

                            <p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of buying a sofa bed, make sure there is enough room for it to fully fold out. Most sofa beds require exactly 240 cm of space when folded out. This will vary depending on the type and model of your sofa.</p>
                            <p>You should know that there are sofa beds that will not be as long as stated above. A good example is the two seater sofa. However, you&rsquo;ll also need to allocate extra space at the edge of the bed if you need walking space around it.</p>
